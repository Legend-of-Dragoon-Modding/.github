## Greetings! 
Hello and welcome to the org profile for the Legend of Dragoon modding community! This is where we house our open-source coding projects made by fans for public use. Currently, our most popular code-related projects are the Dragoon Modifier modding suite, and the upcoming Upscale mod that features improved graphic fidelity. Note that this only covers code-related projects. [View full project list](https://legendofdragoon.org/projects/).

## Documentation
Some documentation can be found in the community resource archive. Most of the archive is being moved to our web server, but for the time being our text documents and spreadsheets are still housed on Google Drive. [Click here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1V73BC8X9j_FW1lo6DiQI7FXDzhmQ77wM) to go to the Modding subfolder.
<!--
If we have any documentation within our repositories, those should be mentioned as well. Actually, is it best if we put all modding-related documentation on these repositories? Or should we keep them separate in a place like Google Drive (as we currently do) or even our web server? What's considered best-practice?
